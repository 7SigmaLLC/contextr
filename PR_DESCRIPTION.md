### 4. Output Renderers
- **Markdown Renderer**: Creates documentation with syntax highlighting and table of contents
- **HTML Renderer**: Generates interactive HTML with collapsible sections and security warnings
- Enhanced console and JSON renderers

### 5. LLM Reviewer Support
- Base framework for LLM-powered code review
- Local LLM integration with support for Ollama, LLama.cpp, and GPT4All
- No API key requirements - works with locally installed models
- Code summarization and security analysis capabilities

### 6. CLI Enhancements and UI Studio Mode
- New commands for tree operations and security scanning
- Visual interface for building context and managing files
- File tree navigation with drag-and-drop support
- Configuration management with visual controls

## Technical Improvements

### 1. TypeScript Fixes

- Better error handling and reporting

## Documentation Updates

### 1. Comprehensive Documentation
- Updated README.md with detailed usage examples
- Added RELEASE_NOTES.md with version 1.1.0 details
- Created UPDATES.md documenting changes from enhanced version
- Added VSCode extension concept documentation

### 2. Examples
- Added comprehensive examples demonstrating all features
- Examples for both CommonJS and ES modules
- Security features demonstration
- Tree view and list-only mode examples

### 3. Visual Documentation
- Added architecture diagrams
- Created usage example visualizations
- Added logo and UI mockups

## Testing Enhancements

### 1. Comprehensive Test Suite
- Added tests for all new features
- Improved existing test coverage
- Created test documentation in docs/testing.md

### 2. Test Files
- Plugin System Tests: PluginManager.test.ts, PluginEnabledFileContextBuilder.test.ts
- Security Scanner Tests: GitIgnoreSecurityScanner.test.ts, SensitiveDataSecurityScanner.test.ts
- Output Renderer Tests: MarkdownRenderer.test.ts, HTMLRenderer.test.ts
- Pattern Matching Tests: RegexPatternMatcher.test.ts, WhitelistBlacklist.test.ts

## Breaking Changes

None. This release maintains backward compatibility with previous versions.

## Future Plans

1. Implement the VS Code extension based on the concept document
2. Add more security scanners and output renderers
3. Enhance LLM integration capabilities
4. Improve documentation for the plugin system

## How to Test

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Build the library:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Run the example usage:
   ```bash
   node dist/cjs/example-usage.js
   ```

4. Launch the Studio UI:
   ```bash
   npx contextr studio
   ```

5. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
