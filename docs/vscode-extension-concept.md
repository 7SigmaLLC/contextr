# ContextR - VSCode Extension Concept

This document outlines the concept for a VSCode extension that would integrate with the ContextR library to provide a seamless experience for managing context directly within the IDE.

## Features

1. **Context Explorer Panel**
   - Tree view of project files with checkboxes for inclusion/exclusion
   - Drag and drop support for organizing context
   - Filter options for file types, directories, and patterns

2. **Right-Click Integration**
   - Right-click on files/folders to add to context
   - Options for include/exclude with pattern support
   - Quick actions for common operations

3. **Context Management**
   - Save/load named contexts
   - Export context to various formats
   - Share contexts between team members

4. **Search Integration**
   - In-file search with regex support
   - Preview matches with context
   - Filter files based on content

5. **LLM Integration**
   - Direct sending to configured LLM endpoints
   - Context size optimization
   - Template support for prompts

## Implementation Approach

The extension would be built using the VSCode Extension API and would leverage the existing ContextR library for core functionality. The extension would provide a UI layer on top of the library, making it easy to use directly within VSCode.

### Technical Components

1. **Extension Activation**
   - Register commands, views, and context menus
   - Initialize configuration and state management

2. **TreeView Provider**
   - Custom tree view for project files
   - State management for selection status
   - Filtering and sorting capabilities

3. **Context Menu Contribution**
   - Register context menu items for files and folders
   - Implement command handlers for menu actions

4. **WebView Panel**
   - Interactive UI for advanced configuration
   - Preview of generated context
   - Search interface with result highlighting

5. **Configuration Management**
   - Extension settings for default behaviors
   - Workspace-specific configurations
   - Global and project-level context storage

## User Experience Flow

1. User installs the ContextR extension
2. Context Explorer panel appears in the sidebar
3. User can browse project files and select items for inclusion
4. Right-click on files/folders provides quick access to context actions
5. User can configure patterns, search for content, and preview the context
6. Save named contexts for different purposes
7. Export context or send directly to configured LLM endpoints

## Development Roadmap

1. **Phase 1: Core Functionality**
   - Basic file tree with selection
   - Simple include/exclude patterns
   - Context generation and preview

2. **Phase 2: Enhanced Features**
   - Search integration
   - Advanced pattern matching
   - Context management (save/load)

3. **Phase 3: LLM Integration**
   - Direct sending to LLM endpoints
   - Context optimization
   - Template support

4. **Phase 4: Collaboration Features**
   - Sharing contexts between team members
   - Version control integration
   - Team-wide configuration

## Technical Requirements

- VSCode Extension API
- TypeScript
- ContextR library integration
- WebView API for custom UI
- FileSystem API for context storage

This concept represents a natural evolution of the ContextR tool, bringing its powerful capabilities directly into the development environment where users spend most of their time.
